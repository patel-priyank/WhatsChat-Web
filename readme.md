# WhatsChat Web

Tired of saving someone's number in your contacts as *Aaa*, just to send a WhatsApp message to them, and forget about it later?

WhatsChat Web uses the public WhatsApp API to initiate a chat with any number, regardless of whether it's in your contact list. Just type a number and hit Chat!
